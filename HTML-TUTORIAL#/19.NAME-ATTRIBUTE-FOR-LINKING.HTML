            <P>A keyboard is one of the primary input devices used with a computer. Similar to an electric typewriter, a keyboard is composed of buttons used to create letters, numbers, and symbols, and perform additional functions. The following sections provide more in-depth information and answers to some of the frequently asked questions about the keyboard.<H5>Types of keyboards :</H5>
Today, most keyboards are similar to each other but may be missing one or more of the sections mentioned earlier (e.g., the keypad). Where keyboards begin to differ the most is in their construction and design. Some keyboards are mechanical, while others use membrane keys. Some keyboards utilize a standard design, like the Saitek keyboard pictured above, and others are split down the middle, utilizing an ergonomic design. Some keyboards are rigid and always the same shape, while others are flexible and can fold in half or roll up.
Most keyboards use the QWERTY layout, but there are still designs that utilize the DVORAK layout.</P>

        <B>MOUSE</B>
        <P>A computer mouse is a handheld hardware input device that controls a cursor in a GUI (graphical user interface) for pointing, moving and selecting text, icons, files, and folders on your computer. In addition to these functions, a mouse can also be used to drag-and-drop objects and give you access to the right-click menu.

            For desktop computers, the mouse is placed on a flat surface (e.g., mouse pad or desk) in front of your computer. The picture is an example of a Logitech desktop computer mouse with two primary buttons and a wheel.</P>

        <A NAME="OMR">
        <B>OMR</B>
        <P>The acronym “OMR” stands for Optical Mark Recognition. This popular and highly accurate recognition technology is used for collecting data from “fill-in-the-bubble” types of questions on student tests, surveys, ballots, assessments, evaluations, and many other types of forms. OMR can be confused with other types of recognition including: OCR (Optical Character Recognition) – reading machine printed characters, and ICR (Intelligent Character Recognition) – reading handwritten characters

            Optical Mark Recognition enables the respondent to select an answer to a question by filling in a “bubble” or “mark” associated with an answer choice. For instance, in the image on the right the respondent selected Excellent in a box to indicate that the location was Excellent.</P>
